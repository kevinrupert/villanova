Dean Havens has more than 20 years of national and international experience in nursing practice, academia, administration and research. Throughout her career, Dean Havens has served in a number of leadership roles, including at the Pennsylvania State University College of Nursing and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Nursing, where she served as interim dean. Most recently, she was a visiting international scholar at the School of Nursing, Midwifery and Social Work at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia. Dean Havens’ career as a practitioner, teacher and scholar has been distinguished by her passionate commitment to community and global initiatives to improve the health of underserved populations. “I am both honored and excited to return to my alma mater. … The College is where I was mentored to become the nursing professional that I am today, so returning to Villanova seems most appropriate,” she says.

          <h3 class="title-2">Honoring a Transformative Dean</h3>
          <p class="regular mar-top">
            Deborah “Dee” Silvers Adams ’86 FCN and her husband, Nick, have made a $5 million commitment to provide anchor support for the naming of the M. Louise Fitzpatrick College of Nursing. The largest philanthropic commitment in the College’s history, the Adams’ gift honors the legacy of M. Louise Fitzpatrick, EdD, RN, FAAN, the College of Nursing’s visionary dean of nearly 40 years, who passed away in 2017. The College’s naming, announced in December, was made possible through philanthropic support. More than $12.8 million in gifts and pledges have been made by alumni, parents and friends in honor of Dean Fitzpatrick; in total, $33.9 million was raised in support of the Fitzpatrick College of Nursing during the Villanova Campaign to Ignite Change.
