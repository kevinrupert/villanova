          <h3 class="title-2">Enriching Penn Relays Legacy</h3>
          <p class="regular mar-top">
            The Wildcats entered the 124th running of the historic Penn Relays Carnival April 26 repre­senting a storied program: The Villanova men’s and women’s teams had more than 130 com­bined Championship of America relay titles between them. When the competition ended April 28, they had five more. 
          </p>
          <p class="regular mar-top">
            The men captured first place in the distance medley relay and the 4xMile relay. Sophomore Casey Comber became the first Villanova men’s runner since John Marshall in 1982 to anchor two winning relays in the same year. 
          </p>
          <p class="regular mar-top">
            The women took the titles in the distance medley relay, 4x1500 meter relay and 4x800 —completing what is known as a “distance triple.” It is the second straight year, the third time in five seasons and the seventh time overall that the Wildcats have achieved the feat.
          </p>
          <p class="regular mar-top">
            In addition, freshman thrower Taryn Ashby finished first in a field of 28 in the college section of the javelin.

          <h3 class="title-2">Men’s Lacrosse Goes to NCAA Tournament</h3>
          <p class="regular mar-top">
            Capping a season in which the team recorded the best start in its history and was ranked as high as fourth in the nation —the highest in program history—by the United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association, the Men’s Lacrosse team earned its third-ever bid to the NCAA Tournament. Senior Christian Cuccinello was selected by USILA as an Honorable Mention All-American, and his 168 career goals is tied for fifth all-time in program history.
          </p>
          <h3 class="title-2">Villanova Honors Senior Student-Athletes</h3>
          <p class="regular mar-top">
            At the annual Senior ­Student-Athlete Reception May 17, Men’s Basketball player Jalen Brunson and Women’s Track and Field and Cross Country athlete Siofra Cleirigh ­Buttner took home top honors as the male and female Senior Student-Athletes of the Year for academic and athletic excellence. 
          </p>
         <p class="regular mar-top">
            Brunson, a Communication major, led Villanova to its second national title in the last three seasons. He graduated as one of the most decorated student-athletes in school history. 
          </p>
         <p class="regular mar-top">
            Cleirigh Buttner, who also majored in Communication, is a top middle distance runner. She is a five-time All-American, 10-time Big East champion and eight-time Penn Relays champion for the Wildcats.
          </p>
          <h3 class="title-2">Slam Dunk Gift</h3>
          <p class="regular mar-top">
            The University received a $1 million commitment from Kyle Lowry — a three-time NBA All-Star guard for the Toronto Raptors and US Olympic gold medalist — and his wife, Ayahna. To recognize this donation, which is the largest single gift from a Villanova Basketball alumnus, the University will christen the Kyle Lowry Men’s Basketball Locker Room in the Finneran Pavilion.
